Corrections before third submission (resubmitted 7/24/2015):
-made "utf-8" lowercase
-made hex references lowercase
-fixed weird instances of tab+space and 4spaces instead of tabs
-changed the <picture><source entries to use tabs instead of spaces before attributes on a new line, although I had done that on purpose. To me:
		<picture>
			<source
			  media="(min-width: 810px)"
			  srcset="images/banner-800_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-800_lo.jpg">
			<source
			  media="(min-width: 441px) and (max-width: 809px)"
			  srcset="images/banner-medium_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-medium_lo.jpg">
			<source
			  media="(max-width: 440px)"
			  srcset="images/banner-small_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-small_hi.jpg">
			<img src="images/banner-medium_hi.jpg" width="960" alt="web developer header picture" class="banner">
		</picture>
		
is more readable and more descriptive than
		<picture>
			<source
				media="(min-width: 810px)"
				srcset="images/banner-800_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-800_lo.jpg">
			<source
				media="(min-width: 441px) and (max-width: 809px)"
				srcset="images/banner-medium_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-medium_lo.jpg">
			<source
				media="(max-width: 440px)"
				srcset="images/banner-small_hi.jpg 2x, images/banner-small_hi.jpg">
			<img src="images/banner-medium_hi.jpg" width="960" alt="web developer header picture" class="banner">
		</picture>

Notes before second submission (submitted 7/23/2015)
-I'm not really concerned about the quality of the images. My starting point was the quality that I could pull out of the pdf mockup. After that, I wanted to make sure I could use grunt and ImageMagick to create different sizes and qualities. Then I wanted to use picture elements and srcset to pick one (and only one) "appropriate" image. In real life I would start with decent quality, similar size images before I start optimizing and making them responsive. 
PLEASE check that my picture and source elements are handled correctly.
-I removed the paper-button polymer element, I mainly wanted to know I could do it, it was silly to leave it in the first time.
-I added picturefill.min.js, which seemed to take care of the weird duplicate image loading that was happening before.
-I moved my general comments to Readme.md, or notes, or this document. I'll simplify as I go forward.
-I'll get better with organizing my github commits as well.

Corrections from first submission:
-Lots of trailing white space
-Lots of inappropriate spacing in css after the :
-Fixed the single quote around the font
-Did away with the universal selectors
-Fixed indentation errors
-Limited use of ID selectors in css to elements that I am confident will be unique, and which were not causing confusing problems
-Used shorthand properties for everything except font, because I wasn't sure about most of the options.
-Changed html file to index.html
-Code now passes HTML validator
