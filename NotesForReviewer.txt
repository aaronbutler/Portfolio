-I'm not really concerned about the quality of the images. My starting point was the quality that I could pull out of the pdf mockup. After that, I wanted to make sure I could use grunt and ImageMagick to create different sizes and qualities. Then I wanted to use picture elements and srcset to pick one (and only one) "appropriate" image. In real life I would start with decent quality, similar size images before I start optimizing and making them responsive. 
PLEASE check that my picture and source elements are handled correctly.
-I removed the paper-button polymer element, I mainly wanted to know I could do it, it was silly to leave it in the first time.
-I added picturefill.min.js, which seemed to take care of the weird duplicate image loading that was happening before.
-I moved my general comments to Readme.md, or notes, or this document. I'll simplify as I go forward.

Corrections from first submission:
-Lots of trailing white space
-Lots of inappropriate spacing in css after the :
-Fixed the single quote around the font
-Did away with the universal selectors
-Fixed indentation errors
-Limited use of ID selectors in css to elements that I am confident will be unique, and which were not causing confusing problems
-Used shorthand properties whenever I was setting more than one (ie I used padding-left when I only cared about left but used padding if I cared about 2 or more)
-Changed html file to index.html
-Code now passes HTML validator
